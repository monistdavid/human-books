Notes

1. A persona can be viewed as a composite of elements of identity (background facts or user profile), language behavior,
   and interaction style.

Thoughts

1. It is really hard to mimic a human's talking behavior, but that is not important because a book character's
   personality is not complete as well in the book, it is extremely hard to completely regenerate the whole character.
   the key point of showing a book character is to by speaking out its story vividly.
