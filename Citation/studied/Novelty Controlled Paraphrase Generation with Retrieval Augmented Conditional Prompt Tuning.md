Notes

1. The task of paraphrase generation aims at rephrasing a given text while retaining its meaning. The task has 
   several applications including text simplification, semantic parsing, query re-writing, and data augmentation.
2. the standard method of utilizing a pre-trained language model for NLP tasks is to fine-tune all the parameters 
   in the model, it is not the most parameter-efficient.
