2. Retrieval-enhanced machine learning
   1. (REML) refers to models composed of two coupled components: one model that makes predictions by 
      communicating with ùëÅ models each mediating access to a repository of information or knowledge.
   2. The goal of retrieval-enhanced supervised learning models is to minimize the empirical risk.
   3. In its most generic form, each information access system in the proposed REML framework consists
      of five components: (1) Query Generation, (2) Retrieval Model, (3) Response Processing, 
      (4) Feedback Handler, and (5) Storage Handler. In the following subsections, we discuss potential 
      implementations for each component.
